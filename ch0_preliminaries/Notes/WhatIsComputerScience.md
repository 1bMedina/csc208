# I'm not a real scientist, and that's okay.

### Summary
Steven Wartik's post encourages us to challenge our way of thinking when it comes to computer science. Specifically our perspective on computer science (CS) and what it is. He highlights his own experience, stating that while pursuing his bachelors he viewed CS as a science. Then later when pursuing his PhD he viewed it more as a form of engineering. He then goes on to discuss feeling a sense of imposter syndrome when talking about what he did with other scientist, like physicist or engineers. Now he believes that CS can be compares better with philosophy, specifically logic instead of traditional science or engineering fields. A key point he focuses on is that CS is mainly built on abstract models instead of real world experiments and observations. For instance, in the beginning of CS people focused on researching practical things, like how fast a program ran and how much memory they used. But the influence John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjans way of thinking about algorithms changed the way CS was viewed. They decided to focus on efficiency based on data size, instead of things like hardware. This in the end, shifted CS to be more about theoretical models, pushing empirical testing to the back. Finally, he is really saying that CS is better understood as a branch of philosophy rather than a strict science. 

### Why did we read it?
It's likely that we read it because it shows a generalized idea on the future of CS. It encourages different views on what CS is, and if it really does fit into the box of traditional sciences. This helps figure out a better way to approach the field and problems within it. This in the end, helps individuals understand CS on a deeper field and promote better practices when teaching and practicing. 

### Who are John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan? What did they do?
Hopcroft is an American theoretical computer scientist. He is a professor emeritus at Cornell University. He is well known for his books on algorithms and formal languages. He received the Turing Award (jointly with Robert Tarjan) "for fundamental achievements in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures." 

Tarjan is an American computer scientist and a mathematician. He is currently a professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. Tarjan is well known for his pioneering work on graph theory algorithms and data structures. As stated above in Hopcroft's section, Tarjan was jointly awarded the Turing Award with John Hopcroft. 

Together they decided that the model of computation would be a hypothetical computer in which the goal of the algorithm design was to minimize that worst case running time. This work led to the first linear time algorithm for planarity.

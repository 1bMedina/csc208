# Chapter 1.1 - Mathematical Statements

## Vocabulary
- **premise**: statement that is assumed to be true.

- **conclusion**: the final statement in a sequence of statements called an argument. 

- **argument**: a sequence of statements, that last of which is called the **conclusion** and the rest of which are called **premises**. 

- **theorem**: a statement that can be proven true using logic, definitions, axioms, and other theorems.

- **proposition**: a declarative statement that can only be either true or false. 

- **proof**: a valid argument. 

- **statement**: a declarative sentence that is either true or false.

- **quantifier**: are symbols used to specify how many elements in a set satisfy a given predicate.
    - **universal quantifier**: written as $\forall$ and is read "for all".
    - **existential quantifier**: written as $\exists$ and is read "there exists" or "for some".


- **predicate**: is like a statement, but contains a **free variable**. 

- **logical connective**: words that connect two simpler molecular or atomic: "and", "or","if..., then...","if and only if","not".

- **binary connective**: connects two statements: "and", "or","if..., then...","if and only if".

- **unary connective**: applies to a single statement: "not".

- **truth value**: refers to whether a proposition is considered true or false. 

- **propositional variables**: usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: P, Q, R, S,...

- **conjunction**: a statement that combines two other statements using the word "and" or symbol $\land$

- **disjunction**: a statement that combines two other statements using the word "or" or symbol $\lor$

- **implication**: a statement that combines two other statements using the words "if..., then..." or symbol $\to$

- **conditional**: same as above, an if then statement

- **biconditional**: a statement that combines two other statements using the words "if and only if" or symbol $\leftrightarrow$

- **negation**: a symbol used to negate a propositional variable $\neg$

- **truth conditions**: the condition at which a statement is true depending on logic operators. 

- **universal generalization** - the statement obtained by adding enough universal qualifiers to the beginning of the sentence so that all free variables become bound.

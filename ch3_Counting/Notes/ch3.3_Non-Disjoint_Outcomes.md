# Chapter 3.3 Non-Disjoint Outcomes

## Principles:
- **Sum Principle (with sets)**:
    - Given two sets $A$ and $B$, if $A \cap B = \emptyset$, then $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$

## Theorem:
- **Cardinality of a Union (2 Sets)**:
    - For any finite sets $A$ and $B$, $|A \cup B|= |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

- **Cardinality of a Union (3 Sets)**:
    - For any finit sets $A$,$B$, and $C$, $A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$.

## Notes: 
- The sum principle only applies when no outcome belongs to both events
    - The sum principle only applies when $A$ and $B$ are disjoint ($A \cap B = \emptyset$)
        - Then: $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$
        - If sets overlap, adjust by subtracting the intersection to avoid double counting: $|A \cup B|= |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$
        
- **Union** ($A \cup B$)
    - Contains all outcomes in **either** $A$ or $B$ or **both**
    - Represents "event $A$ **or** event $B$ happens"

- **Intersection** ($A \cap B$)
    - Contains outcomes **common to both** $A$ and $B$
    - If $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint** (no overlap), $A \cap B = \emptyset$
        - $\emptyset =$ to an empty set

- **Cardinality** ($|X|$)
    - The **size** (number of outcomes) of a set $X$
    
- We can multiply two events respective probabilities if and only if the two events are independent: if the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other
    - This is to find the probability of two events occuring

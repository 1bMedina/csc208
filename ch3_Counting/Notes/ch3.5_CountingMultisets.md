# Chapter 3.5 - Counting Multisets

## Definitions
- Multiset: A multiset is an unordered collection of elements, each of which can appear any number of times. The number of times an element appears is called multiplicity.
    - Multisets are written using the same notation as sets: a comma-separated list in braces, such as $\set{1,2,2,5}$.

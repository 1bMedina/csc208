# Chapter 3.2 Combining Outcomes

## Definitions
- **Disjoint**: there's no way for set $A$ and set $B$ to both happen at the same time. 

## Principles
- **Sum Principle**: If an event $A$ results in $m$ outcomes, and event $B$ results in $n$ **disjoint** outcomes, then event "$A$ or $B$" results in $m + n$ outcomes. 

- **Product Principle**: If event $A$ can occur in $m$ ways, and each possibility for $A$ allows for exactly $n$ ways for event $B$, then the event "$A$ and $B$" can occur in $m * n$ ways. 

## Notes 
- We speak of counting as the number of **outcomes** that can result from a given **event**.
- There are two ways we can think about **combining outcomes**:
    1. We can combine the *sets* of outcomes
    2. We can combine the *outcomes* in the sets.

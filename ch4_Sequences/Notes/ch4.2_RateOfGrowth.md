# Chapter 4.2 - Rate of Growth

## Notes - 
- Sequences with a constant rate of change is called **arithmetic sequences**. 
- When the *ratio* between successive terms is constant, we call such sequences **geometric**. 
- Geometric sequences are those which have a growth rate that is *proportional* to the sequence itself. 

## Definitions 
### Arithmetic Sequences:
- If the terms of a sequence differ by a constant, we say the sequence is **arithmetic**. If the initial term ($a_0$) of the sequence is $a$ and the **common difference** is $d$, then we have, 
    - Recursive definition: $a_n = a_{n-1} + d$ with $a_0 = a$.
    - Closed formula: $a_n = a + dn$

### Geometric Sequences:
 - A sequence is called **geometric** if the ratio between successive terms is constant. Suppose the initial term $a_0$ is $a$ and the **common ratio** is $r$. Then we have, 
    - Recursive definition: $a_n = ra_{n-1}$ with $a_0 = a$
    - Closed formula: $a_n = a \cdot r^n$
## Formulas 
- Recurrence relation in its difference form: $a_n = a_{n-1} = d$
- Recursive definition for the geometric sequence with initial term $a$ and common ratio $r$ will be: $a_n = a_{n-1} \cdot r; a_0 = a$

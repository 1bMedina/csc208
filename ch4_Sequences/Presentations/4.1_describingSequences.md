# Chapter 4.1 - Describing Sequences
## Practice Problems 1 & 2 - Blu and Rehoboth

## Question 1:

> For the sequence with closed formula $a_n = n^2 + 6n + 3$, find the term $a_8$.

**Answer**: $115$

**Why?**: Were given the closed formula $a_n = n^2 + 6n + 3$ and $a_8$. Since were given $a_8$ ($a_n$ where $n$ is $8$) we can substitute $n$ in the closed formula for $8$. This gives us $a_n =(8)^2 + 6(8) + 3$ which equals $115$. 

## Question 2: 
 
 > Consider the sequence with recurrence relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2$ with initial term $a_0 = 2$. Find the term $a_4$.

 **Answer**: $10$

**Why?**: To start lets tru and find $a_1$. This would give us $a_1 = a_{1-1} + 2$ which equates to $a_1 = a_0 +2$ which we know as $2+2 = 4$ since were given $a_0 = 2$

Now, we can continue this until we get to $a_4$.

Next, 

$a_2 = a_{2-1} + 2 \Rightarrow a_1 + 2  \Rightarrow 4+2 = 6$

Then, 
 
$a_3 = a_{3-1} + 2 \Rightarrow a_2 + 2 \Rightarrow 6+2 =  8$

Lastly,

$a_4 = a_{4-1} + 2 \Rightarrow a_3 + 2 \Rightarrow 8+2 = 10$

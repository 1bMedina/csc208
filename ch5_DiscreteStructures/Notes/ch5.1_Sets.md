# Chapter 5.1 Sets 

## Notation
- A set such as $A = \set{1,2,3}$ can be read as " $A$ is the set containg the elements $1,2 \text{and} 3$
- Symbol $\in$ is read "is in" or "is an element of." This means that $a$ is an element of the set containing the letters $a,b, \text{and} c$ - $a \in \set{a,b,c}$
    - Can use $\notin to represent that an $d$ is not an element of the set
    - When writing something like $x \in A$ we wish to express that one of the elements of set $A$ is $x$ for example: $A = \set{1,b,\set{x,y,z}, \emptyset}$
        - This contains for elements: the number $1$, the letter b, the set $\set{x,y,z}$ and an empty set $\emptyset = \set{}$
        - Being a subset of a set is different from being an element.
- $\N$ is used to denote natural numbers
- $:$ often reads as "such that"
### Set Theory Notation
- $\set{,}$ - We use these **braces** to enclose the elements of a set. So $\set{1,2,3}$ is the set containing 1, 2, and 3
- $:$ - $\set{x : x>2}$ is the set of all $x$ **such that** $x$ is greater than 2. 
- $\in$ - $2 \in \set{1,2,3}$ asserts that 2 is an element of the set $\set{1,2,3}$ 
- $\notin$ - $4 \in \set{1,2,3}$ asserts that 4 is not an element of the set $\set{1,2,3}$ 
- $\subseteq$ - $A \subseteq B$ asserts that $A$ is a subset of $B$: Every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$
- $\subset$ - $ A \subset B$ asserts that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$: Every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$, but $A \neq B$
- $\cap$ - $ A \cap B$ is the intersection of $A$ and $B$: the set containing all elements that are elements of both $A$ and $B$ 
- $\cup$ - $A \cup B$ is the union of $A$ and $B$: the set containing all elements that are elements of $A$ or $B$ or both. 
- $\setminus$ - $A \setminus B$ is the set difference between $A$ and $B$: the set containing all elements of $A$ that are not elements of $B$
- $\overline{A}$ - the complement of $A$ is the set of everything that is not an element of $A$.
- $|A|$ - The cardinality (or size) of $A$ is the number of elements in $A$. 


## Special Sets
- $\emptyset$ - The **empty set** is the set that contains no elements
- $\mathcal{U}$ - The **universe set** is the set of all elements
- $\N$ The set of natural numbers. That is, $\N = \set{1,2,3,...}$
- $\Z$ - The set of integers. That is, $\Z = \set{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,..}$
- $\mathbb{Q}$ - The set of rational numbers
- $\R$ - The set of real numbers.
- $\mathcal{P}(A)$ - The **power set** of any set $A$ is the set of all subsets of A.

## Notes
- the order in which elements are written down does not matter
- In cardinality we do not count repeats

# Chapter 5.1 Sets
## Practice Problem 1

### $A = \set{5,7,8,9,10}$ and $B = \set{5,10,11,15,20}$ Find each of the following sets. 

1. $A \cup B$
    - **Answer**: $\set{5,7,8,9,10,11,15,20}$
    - **Why?**: The definition of a union ($\cup$) is the set containing all elements that are elements of $A$ or $B$ or both. So essentially we combine both sets together, then removing duplicates. We take all unique numbers from both sets.
2. $A \cap B$
    - **Answer**: $\set{5,10}$
    - **Why?** The intersection ($\cap$) contains elements that are in both $A$ and $B$. $5$ and $10$ are the only 2 numbers that are in both $A$ and $B$.
3. $A \setminus B$
    - **Answer**: $\set{7,8,9}$
    - **Why?** A set difference ($\setminus$) contains all the elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$. Essentially, we start with $A$ and remove any elements that also appear in $B$.
4. $B \setminus A$
    - **Answer**: $\set{11,15,20}$
    - **Why?** A set difference ($\setminus$) contains all the elements that are in $B$ but not in $A$. Essentially, we start with $B$ and remove any elements that also appear in $A$.
